There's not much to update this week, I've mostly just been doing lifestyle adjustments in preparation for my remote internship, which starts for me in a week.

Comments are open for the first time on this blog. This was definitely a daunting decision to make, but I found it worthwhile. My social media addiction post last week got a really good response; I have two comments on the post and several other people reaching out to me on private channels, and some good conversations started.

Hope everyone's doing all right.
