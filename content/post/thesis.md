As part of my final year of undergrad I completed my thesis/final project "Restricted-dimension subgradient descent: asymptotic bounds on error" under the supervision of [Dr. Nicholas Harvey](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar/). I'm now posting it here: [thesis](./thesis.pdf). A write-up will follow soon!
