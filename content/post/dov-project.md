I've just finished my first year of my Master's program and I've so far done a couple of course projects in a variety of areas. This is the [Direction-of-Voice filter](https://github.com/AudioMLLab/dov-audio-filter), which I've done with my colleague [Abi Kuganesan](https://dfp.ubc.ca/people/trainees/abi-kuganesan). It's an audio filtration application that filters unintended voice audio out of an audio signal by using machine learning to eliminate the portions of the audio generated by speakers not facing the microphone. Please also check out our presentation and demo that I've uploaded to YouTube!
