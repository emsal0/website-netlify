It's been a long road, but I can finally say I've finished my master's thesis, also under the supervision of Dr. [Nick Harvey](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar) and with input and collaboration from Dr. [Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io). It's available at the [UBC Library](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0417272), and also [locally](/msc_thesis.pdf).
