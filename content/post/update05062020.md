Hi all, I've been trying to post every Monday the past few weeks; this week I missed it in order to instead spend time on my side project, [A Bag of Resistors](https://emsal0.github.io/bag_of_resistors/), now live. It was a lot of fun putting it together and I hope it proves useful to people. I'll make a writeup about it soon.
