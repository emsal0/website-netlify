<p>I've just implemented RSS on my blog. You can find the feed at <a href="https://emsal.me/recent.atom">/recent.atom</a>.
<p>Implementing this was relatively simple: there was a library for it! The Flask website had a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/10/">really easy tutorial</a> that was really easy to adapt to my own database models.</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess that means you can follow this blog on your favourite reader client. RIP Google Reader, so I personally use <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> for those purposes.</p>
